Denver,10.20.0.96,,l2pdavc02.eservices.coop.org,"2,364",Red Hat Enterprise Linux,SSH CBC vulnerability,Pass,2.6,0.0,"SSH contains a vulnerability in the way certain types of errors are handled. Attacks leveraging this vulnerabilty would lead to the loss of the SSH session. According to CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH: 

 If exploited, this attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol in the standard configuration. If OpenSSH is used in the standard configuration, then the attacker's success probability for recovering 32 bits of plaintext is 2^{-18}. A variant of the attack against OpenSSH in the standard configuration can verifiably recover 14 bits of plaintext with probability 2^{-14}. The success probability of the attack for other implementations of SSH is not known.",ssh-cbc-ciphers,22,"Disable SSH support for CBC cipher suite


SSH can be done using Counter (CTR) mode encryption. This mode generates the keystream by encrypting successive values of a ""counter"" function. In order to mitigate this vulnerabilty SSH can be setup to use CTR mode rather CBC mode.","* Running SSH service
